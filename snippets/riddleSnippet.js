    riddle: "You have two ropes. Each rope takes one hour to burn. These ropes are not identical, nor are they uniform; i.e. it does not necessarily take half an hour for half the rope to burn (if you have trouble visualizing this, imagine a rope of varying thickness across its length). With only these two ropes and a way to light them, how do you measure out 45 minutes?",
    answer: "Light one rope on both ends. At the same time, light the other rope on one end. When the first rope is burned up, 30 minutes have passed, and the second rope has 30 minutes of burn left. At this point, like the other end of the second rope. It's 30 minutes of burn will burn up in 15 minutes, and when it's done you will be at 45 minutes.",

If it does not break, then we should try floor 27 (14 + 14 - 1). If it breaks, we need 12 more tries to find the solution. If it doesnâ€™t break, we can try 39 (27 + 12) and so on. Using 14 as the initial floor, we can reach up to floor 105 (14 + 13 + 12 + â€¦ + 1) before we need more than 14 tries.
